# Freecorn's NixOS Configs!

This config is the main configuration i use for NixOS, some stuff has been copied or based off of jimbos configuration
https://git.jimbosfiles.com/Jimbo/NixOS-Config and Jimbo has been a big help in helping setting things up.

## (ONLY THE SERVER NEEDS THE SECRETS.NIX FILE, DESKTOP WILL NEVER NEED IT)

i dont recommend you copy the whole config to your local computer (unless u want to spend at least an hour messing with the config) if you want to do that, fork the project and do as you wish. instead this config should be a reference to copy and paste into your own config (like i done to jimbos config at https://git.jimbosfiles.com/Jimbo/NixOS-Config) aka only use parts of this, not the whole thing.

Make sure u replace 1.png and 2.png with pictures of your choosing since they are encrypted
